	 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input, making it efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>: Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(nÂ²) space. In recursive calls, stack space also counts.</p>
